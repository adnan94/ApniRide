<h2 style="color:white; margin-top:100px;">Honda Accord Sedan </h2>
<h4 style="color:white;">The 2015 Honda Accord is smart with its comfort and passenger space; with a somewhat smaller exterior, Honda has packed more space inside, in about every way possible. The driving position is nice and upright, and for those in front or in back, the plentiful window space allows a good view all around. Rear legroom improved with the redesign, while entry and exit is a strength; the only functionality letdown is that the rear seat folds forward in one clunky piece. Among all these models, we could do with a less confusing control set -- especially the dual-screen infotainment system you get in some trims. Coupe models are of course a little tighter in back, with a slightly stiffer ride; but they pack all the goodness of the sedans into a vehicle with a far sportier roofline.

Both Sedan and Coupe models meet the IIHS standards for 'Basic' frontal crash protection, which you can get by adding this model's active-safety package—Forward Collision Warning, Lane Departure Warning, and Adaptive Cruise Control. There's also a cool LaneWatch Blind Spot Display provides a wide view of the passenger side of the vehicle on the Multi-Information Display (i-MID) screen the moment you flick the turn signal. It's truly one of the coolest new features to debut this past year.

Honda in the past hasn't had much of a reputation for cramming value and convenience features into its vehicles. But that's all been turning around in recent years, with a comprehensive, high-value mid-cycle redesign for the Civic a couple of year ago, and then the full redesign given to the Accord this past year. The Honda Accord Sedan offered in LX, Sport, EX, EX-L, V6, and Touring trims, while the Coupe available in LX-S, EX, EX-L, and EX-L V6 models. The base Accord LX model includes dual-zone automatic climate control, 16-inch alloys, Bluetooth connectivity, a rearview camera system, and an eight-inch i-MID display with Pandora audio streaming and SMS text-message capability. V-6 models get some nicer cabin appointments, and EX-L models have a 360-watt system with Aha internet radio streaming. Adaptive Cruise Control is exclusive to the Touring Sedan.

Honda walked a delicate dance when it redesigned the Accord last year, and the model entered its ninth generation. Honda added some of the design flair and sophistication that's been sweeping the likes of the Nissan Altima, Ford Fusion, and Mazda 6; yet simultaneously it's delivering to repeat-buyer expectations with some clear nods to the elegant, upright look of Accords past--and to a little more practicality than those swoopier designs.

It feels a bit as if Honda has designed this Accord from the inside out. In fact they insist that they have; and this approach results in a very smart interior. Honda aims to make it luxurious and modern, and a rather low instrument panel—pushed as far forward, and out at the corners, to maximize space—but with important controls placed quite high within it. While trims and materials do get a more premium look as you rise up the ladder to the top Touring models, both EX-L and Touring trims get a touch-screen audio system that introduces the need for two separate screens and we think ends up adding clutter and complexity to the interior look.

The rather low instrument panel, and an interior design that really pushes out the corners, altogether enforces a sense of space and airiness, though, and important controls are placed quite high and in the line of sight. With Coupes, you give up some practicality for a performance look; they're mostly the same as sedans from the front seats forward.
