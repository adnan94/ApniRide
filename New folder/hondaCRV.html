<h2 style="color:white; margin-top:100px;">Honda CR-V</h2>
<h4 style="color:white;">This is the fourth incarnation of the Honda CR-V, a car that has some off-road ability, but majors on providing practical family transport and a high vantage point on the world.

The latest version looks even less like a rugged off-road machine than its predecessors, and is the first CR-V to be offered without four-wheel drive to minimise fuel consumption.

It has space for five and a huge boot, while Honda's reliability record suggests it should prove very reliable.The latest Honda CR-V is based on the previous model, but manages the neat trick of offering more interior and luggage space while being slightly lower and shorter. That's mainly because the floor is now lower, although the occupants still have an excellent view out through the deep windows. Three people can happily sit in the back seat, and there's no lump in the floor for the centre passenger to negotiate.

Pulling a handle located on one side of the very generous boot space causes that side's rear seat cushion to flip forward, the headrest to do likewise and the backrest to fall into the vacated space, creating a completely flat extended load floor. However, even when the rear seats in place the boot is big enough to swallow a family’s holiday luggage.

Up front there’s a cup holder and a box under the armrest, as well as a traditional manual handbrake, which makes manoeuvring in confined spaces easier and smoother than with the electric one found in many new cars. You sit quite high, but there's nothing van-like about the comfortable driving position with its multiple adjustments for seats and steering wheel.

Less impressive is the CR-V's behaviour on imperfect road surfaces, on which the composure and serenity it shows on smooth roads starts to fall apart. You notice thumps and fidgets beneath you, and the whole car can feel a touch vague and wobbly at speed.

All three of the engines available are smooth and quiet when warmed up, but the two diesels are quite noisy when you first start the car. Speedometers come no clearer than the CR-V's large dial dead ahead of the driver, flanked by smaller but equally crisp semi-circular instruments for the rev counter, fuel level and engine temperature.

The other controls are well laid out, including those on the steering wheel for the trip computer and other functions, but there is a confusing multiplicity of buttons straddling the satellite-navigation screen.

It's annoying to have to press the heater's single air-distribution button repeatedly to select the combination you want, and then look at a screen to see what you've selected. But at least that screen is right at the top of the dashboard, is very easy to see, and incorporates a very visible clock displaying the time both as a clock face and a digital readout.

The Honda CR-V's interior ambience doesn't have quite the padded, tactile slickness of German rivals, but it feels very solid and the whole car comes across as a quality job. You get a great view of the road in front of you, but the CR-V's considerable size can make it tricky to park. More expensive versions come with much-needed parking sensors.

Otherwise this is an easy car to drive, whether you choose the smooth manual gearbox or the optional automatic, although the latter isn’t available with the smaller diesel engine.

It’s also worth noting that the smaller diesel only drives the front wheels, whereas other CR-Vs are available with four-wheel drive. On the road you rarely feel the difference, but it would be a different story on a very slippery surface. Precise steering is a big plus, and helps to disguise the CR-V's bulk up to a point, but there are times when it can feel a bit top-heavy. It's fine if all you want to do is sit back and relax, but doesn’t encourage any form of spirited driving in the way that a Mazda CX-5 does.

The smaller but more economical of the two diesel engines feels a bit overwhelmed in the heavy CR-V, while the petrol also needs to be worked hard. If you can afford its higher price, the bigger diesel is the engine to choose. Hondas are usually very strong in this area

Honda has an impressive reliability record, and the CR-V performed well in the 2013 JD Power customer satisfaction survey, finishing 21st out of 116 cars.

The three-year, 90,000-mile warranty that you get with a CR-V is also better than the 60,000-mile deals offered by most rivals, but  toyota ">Toyota trumps Honda here by offering a five-year, 100,000 mile warranty on its RAV4. Were we considering only the smaller diesel, which returns an official average of 62.8mpg, the CR-V would score more highly than 7/10.

However, the bigger diesel engine isn’t as efficient as the similarly-powerful Mazda CX-5 diesel. And the petrol CR-V is very thirsty, especially when fitted with an automatic gearbox. There really seems no reason to buy one. </h4>
