<h2 style="color:white; margin-top:100px;">The New CR-Z Hybrid Auto/Manual</h2>
<h4 style="color:white;">
The CR-Z is an ambitious attempt at making a sporty hybrid, but its performance doesn’t match its adventurous styling. The good news is that it’s the only hybrid sold with a manual—a six-speed—but the bad news is that the combined output is a mere 130 hp. A 1.5-liter four-cylinder pairs with an electric motor; the EPA rates it for 36-mpg city/39-mpg highway with the optional CVT; the manual gets 31/38. Standard features include Bluetooth capability, automatic climate control, and cruise.The CR-Z’s real achievement is longevity. Since it has survived to the 2016 model year, Honda whipped up a minor refresh and introduced a more expensive EX-L trim level. Outside, the 2016 CR-Z gets new front and rear bumpers. The formerly body-color paint at the bottom of the glass-topped hatch is now gloss black. And the license-plate mount has adopted a more polygonal shape.

Inside, the most obvious change is the center console, which now features a closed storage bin and an armrest where the handbrake lever once lived. That’s right, Mugen boys: No more crazy e-brake turns, as the 2016 CR-Z now has an electronic parking brake. Additional plastic brightwork adorns the dash, door handles, and shifter, and all CR-Z models get keyless entry and push-button start. A seven-inch touch-screen audio system is newly standard, too. EX-L models, befitting Honda practice, bring heated leather seats with contrast stitching, while LaneWatch—Honda’s side-mirror camera that displays an image from the passenger-side blind spot on the central screen—now is standard on the EX and higher.

Honda’s Integrated Motor Assist, a simple hybrid setup that dates back to the original Insight, carries on unchanged. The 1.5-liter four-cylinder and 20-hp electric motor combine for 130 horsepower and 140 lb-ft of torque. (Choosing the CVT, a $650 option on all trim levels, drops torque to 127 lb-ft.) As before, the CR-Z rides on skinny, 195-width 16-inch tires and a suspension consisting of front struts and a rear torsion beam. But engineers installed a 1-mm thicker front anti-roll bar, widened the rear track by 0.4 inch, and enlarged the front and rear brakes by 0.8 and 0.9 inch (for a diameter of 11.1 inches at all four corners).With all these updates, the CR-Z costs $150 more than the 2015 model, starting at $21,130 for the LX manual, $22,975 for the EX manual, and topping out at $25,925 for the EX-L CVT. Fuel economy stands at an EPA-rated 31/38 mpg city/highway with the manual and 36/39 for the CVT. Those used to be impressive numbers, before highway ratings for nonhybrid mid-size sedans like the Kia Optima (39 mpg) and the Mazda 6 (38 mpg) began climbing into the upper 30s.

Honda appears to have seen the light. Its other slow-selling IMA-based hybrids, the Civic hybrid and the Insight, already have been discontinued. The company’s latest Earth Dreams powertrains, as was seen in the Accord hybrid, offer the impressive power and fuel savings we’ve wanted all along in the CR-Z. Although it’s not dead yet, the CR-Z in its current form may be on its way out, with the next generation becoming more of a true sports car. We think that would be a smart move.</h4>
